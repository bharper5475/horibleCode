Horrible coding assignment by Brad Harper and Jacob Pierno - 09/23/2025

The practices that we will be implementing/violating are:

1. YAGNI 
2. Document your Code
3. Clean Code

Assignment description:

In this lecture, we learned about several best-practices for coding. For this activity, you will be demonstrating your understanding of best coding practices. You will be working with a partner to create two versions of a simple program (such as a calculator, fortune teller, tic-tac-toe or anything else): one following recommended programming practices, and one that explicitly violates these practices. Both of you need to submit, but you can submit the same document. 

Requirements:

- Complexity. Your program should use at least three functions. For example, for a calculator, each of the calculations should be its own function.

- Select three principles from the list below to include in your coding demonstration.

1. KISS

2. DRY Code

3. Composition over inheritance/Sub-class explosion 

4. Single responsibility

5. Separation of Concerns

6. YAGNI

7. Document your Code (note common commenting errors)

8. Clean code (note common principles of clean code)

Include a description of your code and the coding best practices you are demonstrating or violating.

Submission should include the following:

1 - .pdf describing your code and how you implemented/violated the principles

2 - two .py files (one with the issues, one with the fixes)

OR

Github link with all your files.

BONUS: +5

Use Github to work on the code together. Provide screenshots of your commits, branches, etc. Include your Github repository link.
