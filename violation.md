1. YAGNI 
This code violates YAGNI by including unnecessary and infuriating dialogues.
- There is no need for a calculator to know someone's name and print it out with the result
- There is no need for multiple confirmations of simple calculations
  - (note: the code isn't broken, you need to type "Yes" for one of the multiplying through adding dialogues and "yes" for the confirmation dialogue)
2. Document your Code
   - There is no comments to be seen in the code.
3. Clean Code
   - The code is convoluted and difficult to read
   - Variable names are just letters instead of descriptive names
   - The order of input dialogues doesn't match up with the input checks, leading to confusion even during coding
